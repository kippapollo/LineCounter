# Dependency

SauvolaNet is written in the TensorFlow.
  
  - TensorFlow-GPU: 1.15.0
  
Other versions might also work but are not tested.


# Demo

Download the repo and create the virtual environment by following commands

```
conda create --name LineCounter --file requirements.txt
```

Download [trained-model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMUkyg67QLLzyDMkU1vgnsgDIKb9SPF9/view?usp=sharing)

***
Put trained-model in **LineCounter/expts/Allx768xDnCNN/models/BF32:BLK5:BN0,0:M8:LArelu:LCbefore_decoder:SC0:DSdrop:USbilinear:BD1:N0.00:P1/**

**You can download BF32_BLK5_BN0%2C0_M8_LArelu_LCbefore_decoder_SC0_DSdrop_USbilinear_BD1_N0.00_P1-0.9830.h5.001 ~ 007 files from Github and merge one .h5 file with 7-zip(I split with 7z2201-x64.exe)**
***
Then play with the provided ipython notebook.

Alternatively, one may play with the inference code using this [google colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v-h7eSNhxfCTqQZC_IPGEp_s-sfA6dxn?usp=sharing).
